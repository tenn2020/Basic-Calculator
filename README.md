# Basic-Calculator
Simple python calculator using PLY library.

This calculator supports binary operators in Python programming.

- Arithmetic Operators
  - performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo operation.
  
- Relational Operators
  - Used for making boolean decisions. Depending upon the condition, it returns either 1.0 or 0.0. When the condition with these operators is true, 1.0 is returned. If the condition is false, it returns 0.0.
  
- Logical Operators
  - Logical operators are usally used along with relation operators. Like relational operators, output of these operators is either True (1.0) or False (0.0).
  
- Assignment Operators
  - Assignment operators are used to assign value to an identifier, a variable. With execution of assignment operators, value at the right is assigned to the left. The destination variable loses the old value; i.e. old value is over ridden with the new value. If previous value is also required; it should be saved in some other variables.
  
- Bitwise Operators
  - The bitwise operators are the bit manipulation operators. They can manipulate individual bits.
